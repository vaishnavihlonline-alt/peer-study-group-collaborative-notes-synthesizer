# AGENTS.md: project rules (read automatically by Antigravity, Cursor and Claude Code)


# Project: RecallRoom (Community Knowledge Memory)

A hackathon prototype. A group learns together; the agent remembers peer
explanations, doubts, and quiz mistakes, and gets smarter over time.
Memory (Hindsight) is the STAR of the product, not a feature.

## Stack
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) in `backend/`
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind in `frontend/`
- LLM: Groq via its OpenAI-compatible API. Default model `openai/gpt-oss-120b`,
  fallback `qwen/qwen3-32b`
- Memory: Hindsight Cloud (`https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io`) using the
  `hindsight-client` Python package

## Hindsight rules (IMPORTANT)
- ALL Hindsight calls live in `backend/memory.py`. No other file imports the client.
- Only use methods that exist in `reference/hindsight_client.py`. NEVER invent
  methods or parameters. If unsure, read that file first.
- Client init: `Hindsight(base_url=..., api_key=...)`. Read both from `.env`.
- Bank id: `group-dsa`. One bank per group.
- Every `retain` MUST include `timestamp`, `context`, and `tags`.
- Tag scheme (lowercase, always these prefixes):
  - `topic:<name>`   e.g. topic:dp, topic:graphs, topic:heaps
  - `type:<kind>`    explanation | doubt | quiz_attempt | session_summary
  - `person:<name>`  e.g. person:rahul
  - `outcome:<x>`    pass | fail (quiz_attempt only)
- Use `recall(..., tags=[...], include_source_facts=True)` for the answer path.
- Always return the raw recalled memories to the frontend so the Memory Panel
  can show them.

## LLM rules
- Every Groq call goes through one helper in `backend/llm.py`.
- Retry up to 3 times on function-calling errors, malformed JSON, or timeouts.
  After 3 failures, fall back to a plain-text answer. Never crash the request.

## Product rules
- The Memory Panel (recalled memories with author, date, tags) must be visible
  on every main page.
- Memory ON/OFF toggle: OFF = LLM sees only the question. ON = LLM also gets
  recalled memories. Show both answers side by side.
- If recall returns nothing, say "I don't have anything on that yet." Never
  invent peer explanations or attribute quotes to people.
- Quizzes are a small extra. The headline features are recall and the group gap map.

## Code rules
- Keep it simple. No auth, no extra database. Hindsight is the memory store.
- Secrets only in `.env`. Never hardcode keys. `.env` must be in `.gitignore`.
- Small functions, type hints, short docstrings. Commit-ready after each step.
